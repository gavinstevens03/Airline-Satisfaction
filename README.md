# Airline-Satisfaction
Analysis of airline passenger survey data to improve overall customer satisfaction.

Libraries: Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, NumPy

Dataset credit: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/teejmahal20/airline-passenger-satisfaction (found in train.csv)

## Overview
In this notebook, I analyze a .CSV file of over 100,000 airline passenger surveys to see what customers value. At the conclusion of the analysis, I offer general business suggestions for the airline to adapt.

This is by no means a complete analysis, but it offers a general view of what passengers value.

## End Goal?
The end goal of this project, which I am still working on, is to be able to predict the overall satisfaction of a passenger given their survey results. This would be accomplished using machine learning libraries, such as TensorFlow SciPy. This is still a work in progress, but I wanted to at least upload my data analytics work.
